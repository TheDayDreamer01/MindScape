# MindScape

### Project Overview

`MindScape` is a mental health application designed to help individuals better manage their mental health and improve their overall well-being. The app provides a range of tools and resources that can be used to help users manage stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

The overall goal of `MindScape` is to empower individuals to take control of their mental health and well-being. By providing users with the tools and resources they need to manage their mental health, the app aims to help users feel more confident, resilient, and empowered in their daily lives.
